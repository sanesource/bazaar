## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install dependencies:**

```bash
# Automatic setup (recommended)
./scripts/setup.sh      # Linux/macOS
scripts\setup.bat       # Windows

# Or manual installation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it! The application uses only 3 lightweight dependencies:

- `yfinance` - For fetching stock market data (free API)
- `pandas` - For data processing
- `requests` - For HTTP requests

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Running the Application

**Quick launch:**

```bash
./scripts/run.sh        # Linux/macOS
scripts\run.bat         # Windows
```

**Or directly:**

```bash
python main.py
```

### Features Explanation

- **Auto-Refresh**: Data automatically refreshes every 60 seconds
- **Manual Refresh**: Click the "üîÑ Refresh Now" button to update immediately
- **Index Selection**: Use the dropdown in Gainers/Losers section to switch between indices
- **Scrollable**: Scroll through all sections using mouse wheel or scrollbar

## üîß Configuration

### Changing Refresh Interval

Edit `main.py` and modify the refresh interval (in seconds):

```python
self.refresh_interval = 60  # Change to desired seconds
```

### Adding New Sections

The application is designed to be modular. To add a new section:

1. Create a new class in `ui_components.py` that inherits from `BaseSection`
2. Implement the `update()` method
3. Add the section to `main.py` in the `create_ui()` method:

```python
self.new_section = NewSection(
    self.scrollable_frame, self.colors, self.data_fetcher
)
self.sections.append(self.new_section)
```

### Modifying Stock Lists

Edit `data_fetcher.py` to modify the stock lists for different indices:

```python
self.nifty50_stocks = [
    'RELIANCE.NS', 'TCS.NS', ...
]
```

## üì¶ Building Executable (Optional)

To create a standalone executable for distribution:

### Quick Build

**Option 1: Automated Build Script (Recommended)**

```bash
# Install PyInstaller first
pip install pyinstaller

# Optional: Create application icons from your logo
python3 create_icons.py

# Run the automated build script
python build.py          # All platforms
```

**Option 2: Manual Build**

```bash
# Windows
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name Bazaar main.py

# macOS/Linux
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name Bazaar main.py
```

The executable will be in the `dist/` folder.

### Testing Your Build

```bash
python test_build.py
```

### Complete Build Documentation

For detailed instructions including:

- Platform-specific optimizations
- Build size reduction techniques
- Creating installers and distribution packages
- Code signing
- Troubleshooting

See the **[docs/](docs/)** folder for complete documentation:

- **[BUILD_GUIDE.md](docs/BUILD_GUIDE.md)** - Complete build guide
- **[BUILDING.md](docs/BUILDING.md)** - Quick reference
- **[README_ICONS.md](docs/README_ICONS.md)** - Icon setup guide

**Expected build size:** 60-100 MB (includes Python runtime and dependencies)

## üåê Data Sources

This application uses **free and open-source** data sources:

- **Yahoo Finance API** (via `yfinance` library) - Provides real-time and historical data for Indian stock market indices and stocks

All data is fetched in real-time with no API key required!

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Data Not Loading

- Check your internet connection
- Yahoo Finance API might be temporarily unavailable - try again later
- Some stocks might have different symbols; verify them on Yahoo Finance

### UI Not Displaying Correctly

- Ensure you're using Python 3.8+
- On Linux, you might need to install tkinter: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- Try resizing the window if elements appear cut off

### Performance Issues

- Reduce the number of stocks being tracked in `data_fetcher.py`
- Increase the refresh interval in `main.py`

## üìù System Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 7+, macOS 10.12+, Ubuntu 18.04+ (or any Linux with Python 3.8+)
- **RAM**: 256 MB minimum
- **Storage**: 100 MB (including Python and dependencies)
- **Internet**: Required for fetching real-time data

## ü§ù Contributing
